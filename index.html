  <h1>Robert Downey Jr. and His Rise To Fame</h1>
  <p>Not many people know about the hard past that of RDJ. His father brought out a drug addiction in him that was very hard for him to shake. In fact, he almost ruined his career through his excessive drug
  use. Due to his hard work and dediction to get better, the world was introduced to Tony Stark, aka, Iron Man. Downey says he owes a lot of his recovery to his wife and kids, and he is very thankful
  that he is able to live the life that he's living. </p>
